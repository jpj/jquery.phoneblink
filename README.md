Make Phone Numbers Blink.

You know you really love it when phone numbers blink on a webpage? Don't you
really want to stop and call that phone number? Don't you wish you could
easily make all the phone numbers on your website blink?

**Well now you can!**

### How To ###

```
$(".phone").phoneblink();
```

It's just that simple! And it even works in browsers that foolishly do not support the `<blink>` tag!

### Supported Phone Number Formats ###

* 555-555-1212
* 1-555-555-1212
* (555) 555-1212
