Don't you\r\nreally want to stop and call that phone number? Don't you wish you could\r\neasily make all the phone numbers on your website blink?\r\n\r\n**Well now you can!**\r\n\r\n### How To ###\r\n\r\nJust [get the plugin](https://github.com/jpj/jquery.phoneblink) and\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(\".phone\").phoneblink();\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't have time to be bothered with figuring out what selectors contain your phone numbers? Do it up!\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(\"body\").phoneblink();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's just that simple! And it even works in browsers that foolishly do not support the `<blink>` tag!\r\n\r\n### In Action ###\r\n\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/joshpauljohnson/p7ZPJ/5/\r\n\r\n### Supported Phone Number Formats ###\r\n\r\n* 555-555-1212\r\n* 1-555-555-1212\r\n* (555) 555-1212\r\n* 1-800-DRUIDIA\r\n\r\n### Known Issues ###\r\n\r\n_Doesn't check for previous blink tags_ so subsequent calls\r\n(or phone numbers that smartly already had `<blink>` tags) will\r\nresult in nested blink tags. But what the heck, just gives more blinking.\r\n\r\n_Probably doesn't support international phone numbers_ as well as\r\nphone numbers without area codes or formatting out of the norm.","tagline":"Make Phone Numbers Blink","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
